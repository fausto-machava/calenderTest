## Description

Based on the task provided, I have developed the following small program.

## Technologies
- ### HTML5
- ### CSS3
- ### Javascript
- ### PHP

## Install and run the project
   To have this project running on your local environment, you just need to follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project

To run a PHP-based website, it is recommended to use a server environment such as Apache. For local development, you can clone the website's files into the "www" directory of WampServer or the "htdocs" directory of XAMPP.

```bash
git https://github.com/fausto-machava/calenderTest.git
```

2. Run the project

Navigate on the browser until the page (localhost/calendarfiletext) and enjoy it.
